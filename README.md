# herdr-agent-usage

Model, context, and subscription quota in Herdr's Agent sidebar — grouped by
Space, with brand icons that carry agent status.

Agents are grouped under their Space. Each row leads with this plugin's brand
icon — not Herdr's status ring. The icon colour tracks the agent: yellow while
working, teal while done (until you focus it or move focus away from it), ink-white when idle.
Provider and model stay ink-white; severity colours on the meters still mean
remaining headroom.

The default layout is `gauges`: a meter beside each quota number. Bars fill to
the printed number, and `cx`, `5h`, `7d`, and `30d` all follow `quota-percent`.
Labels are three characters so those periods align; a provider-named window too
long for that column renders as the slot's own label when it is only another
spelling of that period (`Monthly` → `30d`), keeping its meter, and otherwise
keeps a plain row instead of a truncated bar. Meters size to the connected
Herdr endpoint's sidebar — indent and scrollbar included.
Empty fields collapse; percentages can show remaining or used quota. Cache and
TTL are off by default (turn them on in settings if you want them). Tabs that
draw on the same quota keep every tab visible in the Agent panel; duplicate
5h/7d/30d rows collapse to one pane per Space. Grok, Codex, Devin, Cursor,
and Muse share by vendor; Claude by the account of the session's
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` profile; omp, Pi, Kilo, and OpenCode by the account their
session bills (omp by its credential pin, else by the profile and stored
credential that served the session). A tab whose payer cannot be proven keeps
its own row, and so does every Agy tab. Under Herdr's own agent order only
adjacent tabs share a row; the `quota` and `tabs` orders draw every tab of one
account together. On a
wide sidebar, the vendor icon and name sit above that pane's quota, and extra
tabs list model, topic, and context with no icon. A settings row gap of 1 still
separates different agents; nested extra tabs of the same vendor stay flush.
Closing, moving, or leaving a tab regroups the tabs left behind right away.
Agent order defaults to Space grouping with least quota left first inside each space;
`tabs` keeps tab order instead, and `prefix+shift+o` switches between the two.
Low-quota notifications stay off until you set a threshold. Switch layout,
fields, percentages, and optional pacing from the settings pane
(`prefix+shift+q`).

## Install and upgrade

Requires **Herdr 0.9.0+**, the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`,
macOS or Linux, and a supported agent CLI.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/levi-qiao/herdr-agent-usage.git
cd herdr-agent-usage
./install.sh
```

The GitHub repository and Herdr plugin id are both `herdr-agent-usage`.
`./install.sh` adopts an existing `herdr-agent-quota` install even when Herdr
has already switched the linked id, then unlinks the old id. The first launch
of the new binary adopts the same directories. Run `./install.sh` after
pulling so the Cursor hook command is rewritten; until then the previous hook
script keeps running.

To enable a subset, use `./install.sh --agent claude,codex,omp`.
Existing sessions need restarting only when newly installed hooks or Herdr
integrations must be loaded.

The script builds, links, and runs `configure`. It does not finish icons in
every terminal, Herdr integrations, or macOS Keychain approval. To have a
coding agent on this machine complete that, paste the prompt in [Ask an agent
to finish setup](#ask-an-agent-to-finish-setup).

For iTerm2, the optional [Hack Herdr Nerd Font](docs/font-iterm2.md) combines
the Herdr marks with Nerd Font symbols. It is distributed as a release asset
(or can be rebuilt from the pinned sources); install it on the Mac, including
for SSH sessions, and turn off the separate non-ASCII font in that profile.

Upgrade from the repository directory:

```sh
git pull --ff-only
./install.sh
```

Upgrades retain saved preferences, repair managed configuration, refresh quota,
and restore background updates automatically. No cache deletion or watcher
management is required. Changes to the Herdr server connection are adopted by
the watcher automatically.

## Ask an agent to finish setup

`./install.sh` is not the whole job: brand icons need a font map in **this**
terminal, most agents need a Herdr integration, and Cursor/Muse on macOS need
a one-time Keychain **Always Allow**. Paste the following into Claude, Cursor,
Grok, Codex, or any coding agent **on the machine that runs Herdr**. The same
steps, with commands, are in [docs/agent-setup.md](docs/agent-setup.md)
([中文](docs/agent-setup.zh-CN.md)).

```
Install and fully configure herdr-agent-usage on this computer until Herdr's
Agent sidebar shows brand icons and quota for the agent CLIs I actually have.
Stopping after ./install.sh is not done. Icons as boxes or "?" are unfinished.

Repo: https://github.com/levi-qiao/herdr-agent-usage
If this working tree is already that repo, use it; otherwise clone it, cd in,
and follow docs/agent-setup.md (English) or docs/agent-setup.zh-CN.md (中文).
If you cannot read those files, do all of the following anyway.

Rules:
- Do not herdr pane read (especially --source recent). That repaints agent TUIs.
- Do not call a bare `agent` binary (that is Grok when both are installed).
  Cursor's CLI is `cursor` or `cursor-agent`.
- Do not install a Cursor statusLine; it replaces the native footer.
- Plugin actions ignore extra env vars. Pass choices as ./install.sh flags.
- Use rustup for rust-toolchain.toml. Do not brew-install rust.

1. PATH: add ~/.local/bin, ~/.cargo/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin, /usr/local/bin.
   Need herdr 0.9.0+ and rustup/cargo. If herdr is missing, stop. If cargo is
   missing, install rustup (https://rustup.rs), not a distro Rust package.

2. Detect agents as the union of binaries, config dirs, and `herdr agent list`.
   --agent names: claude (claude, ~/.claude), codex (codex, ~/.codex),
   grok (grok, ~/.grok), agy (agy, ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli),
   opencode (opencode, ~/.config/opencode), pi (pi, ~/.pi/agent),
   omp (omp, ~/.omp), devin (devin, ~/.local/share/devin),
   muse (muse or muse-code, ~/.config/muse),
   cursor (cursor or cursor-agent, ~/.cursor),
   kilo (kilo, ~/.local/share/kilo).
   Print the list. If none, install all and say so.

3. From the repo: git pull --ff-only if this is main and clean; then
   ./install.sh --agent <detected,comma,separated>
   Read the full output. font: notes and missing integrations are remaining work.

4. After the script:
   - herdr plugin list must show herdr-agent-usage enabled.
   - Wait for configure/refresh logs to succeed (invoke returns while running).
   - herdr integration status; for each detected agent that is "not installed",
     herdr integration install <id> (claude, codex, grok, opencode, pi, omp,
     devin, cursor, kilo — not agy or muse). Skip CLIs the user does not have.
   - Font: configure copies Herdr Agent Icons Max to ~/Library/Fonts (macOS) or
     ~/.local/share/fonts (Linux) and maps Ghostty/kitty only if those configs
     already exist. Linux: fc-cache that fonts dir. Detect THIS terminal
     (TERM_PROGRAM / KITTY_WINDOW_ID / WEZTERM_EXECUTABLE). PUA U+E1A0–U+E1B6
     needs an explicit map or the cell is a box or "?". Ghostty:
     font-codepoint-map = U+E1A0-U+E1B6="Herdr Agent Icons Max" (and U+E1C0–U+E1C5),
     wrapped in "# BEGIN/END herdr-agent-usage font". kitty: symbol_map those
     ranges to Herdr Agent Icons Max. WezTerm: add the family to font_with_fallback.
     VS Code/Cursor: append it to terminal.integrated.fontFamily. Then reload
     the terminal (Ghostty cmd+shift+,, kitty ctrl+shift+f5). Muse's mark is ◈
     on purpose. Nested extra tabs of the same vendor have no icon by design.
     Yellow "?" on 1.6.1+ is almost always an unmapped terminal; older builds
     used ZWNJ — upgrade.
   - macOS Cursor: if ~/.cursor/cli-config.json has authInfo and
     ~/.cursor/.herdr-keychain-approved is missing, warn the user, then
     ./target/release/herdr-agent-usage refresh --provider cursor --keychain-approve --force
     and tell them to click Always Allow (not Allow).
   - macOS Muse keychain login: same with --provider muse.
   - herdr plugin action invoke refresh --plugin herdr-agent-usage and wait.
   - Tell me which already-running panes to restart (new hooks/integrations).
     Claude/Agy need one turn for StatusLine. Cursor cache needs a turn after
     hooks.json is reloaded.

5. Report: detected vs enabled agents, integrations, font path and which
   terminal you mapped, Keychain, restarts still needed, anything still broken.
   Do not claim icons are correct without a human look or a verified font map.
```

## Settings

Press `prefix+shift+q`, or run the following if that key is already assigned:

```sh
herdr plugin pane open --plugin herdr-agent-usage --entrypoint settings --focus
```

<img src="docs/screenshots/settings.png" alt="Agent quota settings" width="760">

| Setting | Options |
| --- | --- |
| Percentages | Remaining or used; colors always indicate remaining headroom |
| Sidebar pacing | Off (default) keeps quota percentages and gauges; on shows signed pace on 5h/7d rows |
| StatusLine pace | On (default) preserves the existing binding-window pace segment; off leaves Claude's statusLine output unchanged |
| Layout | `gauges` (default) adds a meter beside each quota number; `packed` groups related fields; `stacked` gives each field a row |
| Row gap | Zero or one blank line between agents |
| Watch interval | 30 seconds–1 hour; default 60 seconds |
| Fields | Provider, topic, model, context, short/long/monthly quota on by default; cache and TTL optional |
| Agent order | Group by Space, least quota left first (default); by Space in tab order with one account's tabs together; or Herdr's own policy |
| Low quota alert | Off or a threshold from 1% to 100% |
| Agents | Claude, Codex, Grok, Agy, OpenCode, Pi, OMP, Devin, Muse, Cursor, Kilo |

Use arrows or Space to edit, `a` to apply, and `q` to close.
Installer options are also available through `./install.sh --help`.

Enable sidebar pacing, or opt out of the separate Claude statusLine pace, during installation with:

```sh
./install.sh --sidebar-pacing on
./install.sh --statusline-pace off
```

Paced sidebar rows read like `5h -6% 45 min`: window, signed percentage-point
headroom versus the remaining clock, and time left. Negative means usage is
ahead of pace; positive means there is headroom. `3d2h` is one compact time
value. Context and monthly rows keep their configured quota presentation.
When a provider omits usable reset information, that row falls back to its
normal quota percentage instead of guessing.

## Data sources and limits

| Agent | Quota source | Attribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Codex app-server; 5h and/or 7d | Current login in the plugin's `CODEX_HOME` |
| Grok | CLI billing endpoint; 7d or 30d | Current CLI credentials |
| Devin | CLI usage endpoint; 1d and 7d | Current CLI credentials |
| Muse Code | CLI subscription endpoint; 5h and 7d | Current CLI account login; session via Muse's session lock (Linux) |
| Cursor | CLI DashboardService usage; at, api, and 30d | Current CLI `auth.json`, else the macOS Keychain login from `cursor-agent login`, else `$CURSOR_STATE_DB` (`state.vscdb` access token) when the CLI has no login; model from local session files; topic from the generated session title; `cx` from `store.db` `token_details` (the CLI footer percent); cache from CLI hooks |
| Claude Code | StatusLine; 5h and 7d | Exact session observation |
| Agy / Antigravity | StatusLine; 5h, 7d, and api (third-party pool on Gemini) | Exact session and identifiable model pool |
| OpenCode | OpenCode console Go meters; per-key usage endpoint as fallback | The active console login stored by OpenCode (its `credential` table), which also proves a Go session without a key; the Go API key only when the store holds no console connection |
| Pi | Canonical Codex quota | Only when the recorded account matches |
| OMP | `omp usage --json --provider <id>` | Reported account matching the session's credential pin; one of several stored API keys, which omp reports without an identity, shows the pool (`1/2 keys usable · next 3h10m`) |
| Kilo Code | Kilo Pass account state (`kiloPass.getState`); 30d | The OAuth gateway login in Kilo's `auth.json`, and only for a session whose backend is the Kilo Gateway; context from that session's messages and Kilo's model catalog |

An OpenCode pane that has not started a session yet shows the account's Go
meters when a console login exists; the first resolved session replaces them
with that pane's own backend, or clears them when it is not Go.

Kilo publishes no 5h or 7d bucket for the Kilo Gateway: its allowance is the
monthly credit total, so a Kilo pane shows `30d` and nothing else. An account
without a Kilo Pass plan pays from a shared credit balance instead, and that
balance arrives with no limit attached — there is no honest percentage to
print, so those panes show no quota rather than a number this plugin cannot
source.

The Claude Code status line always keeps the user's own statusLine output.
With **StatusLine pace** enabled (it stays on by default for compatibility), the wrapper appends a
spending pace for the binding window, for example `⏱ 5h ↓12%`: quota used
minus the share of the window's clock already run, in points. `↓` means slow
down, `↑` means there is headroom, `=` is within five points. The window with
the least remaining quota is paced and named; if that window cannot be paced,
nothing is appended rather than pacing the looser one: no reset time, expired,
reset further away than the window is long, or in the first 5% of the window.

Quota windows retain their provider's meaning. Model, context, and cache data
come from the identified session when available. `ttl≈` marks an estimated
prompt-cache lifetime, not a guaranteed expiry. Topic extraction uses the
named pane's visible screen for most agents and preserves the last topic when
it scrolls away. Cursor and Grok use the generated session title from local
session metadata instead; Muse uses the last prompt in its transcript.

All supported working agents participate in one background watcher. Requests
are debounced for 60 seconds, including a final refresh after a turn settles.
OMP additionally retains its own five-minute usage cache. Idle panes sharing a
verified quota source receive the same reading.

Native Codex, Grok, Devin, Muse, and Cursor collectors follow the plugin's current login,
not separate accounts for each pane. Claude/Agy do not report a reliable serving
account ID, so their observations are not shared across sessions. Unknown
identity or model-pool attribution does not produce a guessed quota. Failed
requests preserve the last verified reading for that same account; they do not
turn failures into zero usage.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Brand icons are boxes or `?` | The icon font is missing or this terminal has no U+E1A0–U+E1B6 map — see [Ask an agent to finish setup](#ask-an-agent-to-finish-setup). Reload the terminal after `configure`. A yellow `?` on a build older than 1.6.1 was the working-state ZWNJ bug; upgrade. Muse uses the text mark `◈` on purpose. Nested extra tabs of vendors other than Codex have no icon by design. |
| Session data is missing | Run `herdr integration status`; load missing integrations before restarting the affected agent |
| Claude/Agy quota is missing | Send a turn so the session's StatusLine produces an observation |
| OpenCode Go quota looks frozen | The console login is the source; without it the per-key endpoint is used, and a key that stopped serving traffic keeps its last reading. Sign in with `/connect` so a console login exists, then refresh |
| OMP quota is missing | A row reading `restart pane: no omp session` means Herdr itself has no session for that pane: run `herdr integration install omp` (or reload the plugin, which repairs it at startup) and restart the pane. A row reading `first turn writes the omp session` clears on its own. Otherwise check `omp usage --json --redact --provider <id>` |
| Devin quota is missing | Check the CLI login and `DEVIN_CREDENTIALS_FILE` if customized |
| Muse quota is missing | Run `muse login` (API-key logins have no subscription quota); check `MUSE_AUTH_PATH` if customized. On macOS, a `storage: "keychain"` login also needs a one-time Keychain approval: run `herdr-agent-usage refresh --provider muse --keychain-approve` and click **Always Allow** |
| Cursor quota is missing or stuck on a previous account | Run `cursor login`. On macOS, `cursor-agent login` stores the token in Keychain: run `herdr-agent-usage refresh --provider cursor --keychain-approve` and click **Always Allow**. The desktop app token is only used when the CLI has no login of its own **and** `$CURSOR_STATE_DB` is set |
| Ghostty asks to "access data from other apps" while using Cursor | macOS `SystemPolicyAppData`: a Ghostty child touched Cursor-owned files (`~/.cursor` or Application Support). This plugin does not open those trees on macOS unless `$CURSOR_HOME` / `$CURSOR_AUTH_FILE` / `$CURSOR_STATE_DB` is set. Cursor CLI itself may still prompt (it writes under `~/Library/Caches`). Click **Allow**, or grant Ghostty Files & Folders / Full Disk Access. **Don't Allow** makes later reads fail closed. Reload the plugin after upgrading so the watcher is the new binary. |
| Cursor cache/context is missing | `cx` comes from that session's `store.db`; cache still needs the pane to have reloaded `hooks.json` and sent a turn (headless `--print` does not fire those hooks) |
| Rows are missing | Run the configure action below to repair managed configuration |
| The `gauges` meter disappears on a narrow sidebar | Expected below ~24 columns; widen the sidebar and refresh |
| `gauges` still uses the old width after a resize | Refresh with `prefix+shift+r`; there is no live resize publish path |
| Cache details stay on two lines under `gauges` | Widen the sidebar until the combined row fits |

```sh
herdr plugin action invoke refresh --plugin herdr-agent-usage
herdr plugin action invoke configure --plugin herdr-agent-usage
```

Uninstall everything with `./uninstall.sh`, or remove a subset with
`./uninstall.sh --agent grok`. Configuration changes are reversible; user-owned
settings and other agents remain intact.
