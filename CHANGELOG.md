# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Optional **Hack Herdr Nerd Font** for iTerm2: a release bundle combines
  Hack Nerd Font with all 29 bundled Herdr marks without changing plugin or
  terminal settings. The repository keeps the reproducible builder and
  third-party notices; generated TTFs are published with releases instead of
  being carried in the source tree.
- **Kilo Code.** A Kilo pane gets a sidebar row like any other agent: the
  context its session occupies, and the account's Kilo Pass allowance.
  Kilo publishes no 5h or 7h bucket for the Kilo Gateway — its subscription is
  a monthly credit total — so the row shows `30d` and nothing shorter, and the
  short windows stay empty rather than borrow the monthly number. Kilo publishes
  no rate limit at all, so none is shown either.

  The allowance comes from the account's own Kilo Pass state, authenticated
  with the gateway login in `auth.json`, and the context from that session's
  latest completed step. Attribution is by the login rather than the harness:
  Kilo drives other providers from one CLI, so a session on OpenCode Go routes
  to that account's windows under its own name, and a Kilo Gateway session
  behind a gateway *API key* is not attributed at all — that key bills the same
  account but cannot name it.

  An account with no Kilo Pass pays from a shared credit balance, which Kilo
  reports with no limit attached. Those panes show the balance and no bar: a
  percentage drawn against a denominator that does not exist would be invented,
  and the credit pool's own ratio degenerates to a constant 100% on a drained
  account while reading as "quota exhausted".
- **`--agent-order tabs`.** Keeps Herdr's tab order inside each Space, but
  draws every tab of one account together where the first of them sits, so a
  shared row never splits because another agent's tab sits between two of its
  members. Herdr's own order still nests only adjacent tabs. The new
  "Toggle agent order" action (`prefix+shift+o`) switches between `quota` and
  `tabs`, and from `default` it turns `quota` on. Herdr disables the clickable
  sort label while a plugin view is active, so the toggle is a key, not a click.


### Changed

- A window whose provider label is another spelling of its own period renders
  as the sidebar's slot label in the gauges layout: omp's month pool
  (`Monthly` / `monthly`) shows as `30d` and keeps its meter, so that row
  reads like the `5h` and `7d` rows beside it. The provider's word is
  untouched in the cache and in the dashboard, a label that names something
  else (`Daily`, a provider-specific pool) is never renamed, and a sidebar too
  narrow to meter at all still shows the provider's label.
- Every agent now shares one 5h/7d/30d row per Space when its tabs provably
  draw on the same quota, not only Grok, Codex, Devin, OpenCode, and Cursor.
  Muse shares by vendor. Claude shares by account: the statusLine hook records
  a digest of the account and organization in `oauthAccount` from the
  `.claude.json` of the session's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so two profiles on
  two logins keep two rows and two profiles on one login share one. Claude tabs
  on one account show the newest reading for each period independently, with
  that reading's own age, so updating 5h never replaces a fresher 7d or drops
  a sibling's 7d window. omp shares by the provider and the `credential_pin`
  account its session bills, and Pi and Kilo by the billing target their session resolves
  to. A tab whose payer cannot be proven keeps its own row: a Claude tab with
  no recorded account (an API-key login, or a session whose hook has not run
  since this update), an omp session without a pin, and every Agy tab, whose
  statusLine names no account.
- Under Herdr's own agent order, a shared row only spans adjacent tabs. A tab
  drawn between two same-account tabs splits them, so each side keeps its own
  quota and its gap; the header sits on the first drawn tab.

### Fixed

- A tab whose payer changes mid-session — an omp tab moving from its plan
  model to the implementation provider, or back — regroups the tabs it leaves
  in the same pass. The tab it left behind used to keep its head or child
  styling until its own next event, which for an idle tab could be never.
- An omp pane on one of several stored API keys for the same provider (two
  OpenCode Go keys, say) shows the key pool instead of "quota account is not
  confirmed": how many keys still have quota and when the next exhausted one
  resets (`1/2 keys usable · next 3h10m`). omp's key reports carry no
  identity, so the pane cannot be matched to its own key; the pool is what
  can be proved. That line is a reason, not a window, so it never ranks the
  pane or fires a low-quota alert. For OpenCode Go the pool counts only the
  rolling (5h) and weekly windows omp ranks keys on: an exhausted monthly
  allowance is display-only — it can still serve through the console's
  balance fallback — so it neither benched a key nor delayed the next
  comeback that was reported.
- omp profiles no longer share a usage report or a refresh debounce. A pane
  in one profile could show the only key of another profile's pool for the
  same provider, and wait out that profile's debounce instead of asking its
  own.
- OpenCode tabs share a quota row only when they bill the same subscription.
  Every OpenCode tab in a Space used to join one row whatever backend it was
  talking to, so a pay-per-token tab (OpenCode Zen, Anthropic, …) could become
  the head and hide the Go meters of the tab beside it. A tab whose session is
  not on a subscription now keeps its own row, as omp, Pi, and Kilo tabs do.
- An OpenCode 2 Go session served by the console login gets the Go meters
  without a Go API key. The key in `auth.json` or `OPENCODE_API_KEY` was the
  only accepted evidence, so a console-only install showed no quota at all.
- With more than one console login in the OpenCode store, the Go meters come
  from the connection OpenCode serves with (active first, then newest created)
  instead of the most recently updated login. When that connection is one the
  plugin cannot meter (a service-account key, or a login without a token or
  workspace), no Go meters are shown: an older device login is not used in its
  place, and neither is the Go API key.
- Two omp tabs on a provider omp writes no `credential_pin` for (any API-key
  login) share a row when the same omp profile served both from the same
  stored credential. The newest reply names that credential, so tabs on one key
  no longer stand alone. A newest reply served by a runtime or config key
  carries none and keeps its own row; a reply interrupted before its first
  token is passed over, so Esc does not split the row. Two profiles never
  share a row this way.
- A tab nested under a vendor head no longer jumps above that head when it
  reports new quota. The group's sort key carries the tightest headroom among
  its members, and an event that named one tab rewrote only that tab's key: the
  head kept the old one, and the tab sorted above its own header with nothing
  to show which account it belonged to. Every member whose key moved is now
  republished in the same pass; unchanged members are not written.

- Closing a tab, moving it to another Space, quitting its agent, or starting a
  different agent in it no longer leaves the tabs behind it nested under a
  vendor head, or without a Space header, until the next refresh. `pane.closed`,
  `pane.moved`, and `tab.closed`, plus an agent release or switch, republish
  only the Spaces whose rows no longer match their members. No pane output is
  read.

- A long omp or Pi session no longer empties its pane. Both harnesses append
  one session to one file, and a transcript past 8 MiB was rejected whole, so
  the pane lost its model, quota, and context at once and rendered a bare
  icon. A longer transcript is now read as its header plus its newest 8 MiB:
  the model, account pin, context, and cache activity sit at the end of the
  active branch, so each pane keeps its own current model. Evidence written
  before that window is not reported, since a later entry the window does not
  show may have replaced it, and a long session's cache row shows the latest
  turn's hit rate without a partial session total.
- An omp or Pi pane Herdr has no readable session for now says so in the
  sidebar instead of rendering a brand icon with no rows: `restart pane: no
  omp session`, or for a session Herdr has named but the agent has not written
  yet, `first turn writes the omp session`. Both lead with the step that
  clears them, because a narrow sidebar truncates the row. Both measurements
  came from the transcript, so an unreadable one leaves the pane with no
  provider, no account, and nothing to show — the one state where an empty row
  was the least obvious way for a correct install to look broken. A pane whose
  transcript is already written keeps its earlier silence instead: a model
  switch, a login that cannot be proved to pay for the pane, or a session this
  build does not parse is not waiting for a first turn, and that row would
  never clear.
- Herdr's omp integration is now repaired from `startup` as well as
  `configure --apply`. A machine that installed this plugin before it installed
  omp skipped the collector once and never ran that path again, so every omp
  pane afterwards was detected without a session — no quota, no model, no
  explanation. Startup runs after every Herdr restart, installs the integration
  once omp's own agent directory exists, and stays silent when it does not.
- OpenCode Go quota now reads the console subscription meters behind the
  OpenCode console login — the same numbers the console page shows. The
  per-key `/zen/go/v1/usage` counters remain the fallback for stores without a
  console login; a key that no longer serves an install's traffic freezes at
  its last reading and can disagree with the console. A pane with no session
  yet shows the account meters until its first turn resolves a backend.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Claude statusLine pacing can now be turned off with
  `--statusline-pace off` or from the settings pane. It stays on by default
  for upgrade compatibility; quota observations are still collected for the
  sidebar while pace output is off.
- Optional sidebar pacing for recurring quota windows. Enable it in the
  settings pane or with `--sidebar-pacing on` to render values such as
  `5h -6% 45 min`; the default remains the existing quota/gauge display.

### Changed

- The GitHub repository and Herdr plugin id are now
  [`levi-qiao/herdr-agent-usage`](https://github.com/levi-qiao/herdr-agent-usage)
  / `herdr-agent-usage`. `./install.sh` adopts config and state from
  `herdr-agent-quota` even when Herdr has already switched the linked id, then
  unlinks the old id if it is still listed. The first launch of the new binary
  does the same for the state and config directories Herdr injects. Files the
  new directory already has are kept. The previous Cursor hook script stays at
  its old path until `./install.sh` rewrites `hooks.json`. `./uninstall.sh`
  restores either id.

### Fixed

- Blocked agent panes now tag and color the brand icon instead of looking idle,
  restoring an at-a-glance signal for panes waiting on user input.
- Gauges panes keep the model token when the provider field is hidden, so
  model-only identity rows render the model instead of only the brand icon.
- Claude session-local quota no longer presents an idle pane's old percentage as
  current. The statusLine cache tracks per-window freshness from documented
  API-derived fields, timer-only redraws keep the original observation age,
  and stale values render explicitly as `stale` without current headroom.
  A temporary payload with no `rate_limits` may keep the same session's last
  still-current window, but it keeps the old observation age rather than
  making that percentage fresh again.
- Claude configuration now honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json` when
  `CLAUDE_SETTINGS_FILE` is not set, matching Claude Code's documented
  relocated config directory instead of silently falling back to
  `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- A Claude or Agy statusLine payload that reports only a model id, such as a
  model released after this build, now shows that id instead of a blank
  model. The display name is still preferred when the payload has one.
- `configure --check` reports a Claude or Agy statusLine hook that still
  feeds another install (for example the pre-rename `herdr-agent-quota`
  binary and state directory) as stale instead of installed. Such a hook
  never reaches this plugin, so new sessions show no model or quota until
  `configure --apply` rewrites it.
- Codex quota and per-session models refresh again when Herdr runs the
  plugin. Herdr's server PATH can omit Homebrew, so every hook, action, and
  watcher fetch failed to start `codex app-server` and kept a stale snapshot
  whose model belonged to whatever session a terminal refresh last saw. With
  no `$CODEX_BIN_PATH` and no `codex` on PATH, the collector now tries
  `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, and `/usr/local/bin`.
- `$CODEX_BIN_PATH` set to an npm-style codex shim now starts under Herdr's
  server PATH too. The collector prepends the override's parent directory
  to the child PATH the same way the automatic fallback does, so a shim
  beginning with `#!/usr/bin/env node` resolves `node` next to itself
  instead of failing with `env: node: No such file or directory`.
- Codex panes launched through wrappers that suppress Codex hooks now recover
  their session from Herdr's foreground cwd plus the native Codex process
  start time, matched to exactly one rollout's `session_meta`. The recovery
  runs on every agent inventory read, so the active-turn watcher, focus, and
  sibling publishes keep that session's model and context instead of
  borrowing the newest provider-wide rollout between manual refreshes. Only
  rollouts dated within a day of the process start are opened. Ambiguous
  matches remain unresolved.
- OpenCode 2 sessions resolve again. OpenCode 2 keeps new sessions in
  `session_v2`/`session_message` and carries the role in the `type` column,
  neither of which the collector read: every session created after the upgrade
  looked absent, so its pane lost the model, context, and OpenCode Go quota
  rows. Both store layouts are read now, and a migrated session keeps the
  evidence it already had.
- Cursor quota follows a `cursor-agent login` account switch while a watch
  process is already running. The previous token stays valid, and the
  one-time Keychain approval marker does not move, so caching that secret
  against the marker kept fetching the old account's Dashboard usage.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Running the integration suite from a Herdr pane no longer disrupts the
  current Agent view or temporarily puts a Space header between its own agents.
- Forced quota refresh restores the Agent view. Herdr drops a plugin-owned
  view on disable, and enable does not run startup, so Space grouping fell
  back to native `grouped` until the next server restart. Event/focus/watch
  still do not touch the view.
- The Cursor hook wrapper lives in plugin state instead of `~/.cursor`.
  `afterAgentResponse` and `stop` each spawned `bash` against a
  Cursor-provenance path, so Ghostty prompted `SystemPolicyAppData` twice
  per turn. Restart an already-running Cursor pane after configure so it
  reloads `hooks.json`.

- macOS no longer opens Cursor.app's `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/…/state.vscdb`
  unless `$CURSOR_STATE_DB` is set, and Herdr-spawned processes no longer read
  `~/.cursor` (chats `store.db`, `cli-config.json`, `auth.json`) unless
  `$CURSOR_HOME` / `$CURSOR_AUTH_FILE` / `$CURSOR_STATE_DB` is set. Those trees
  carry Cursor `com.apple.provenance`; this plugin is ad-hoc signed, so each
  event/watch/hook process was prompting Ghostty `SystemPolicyAppData`
  ("would like to access data from other apps"). Credentials stay on Keychain;
  model/cache/context stay on the hook mailbox. The cache identity mtime is
  the plugin-state Keychain marker, not a `stat` of `~/.cursor/auth.json` —
  that leftover watch-tick was enough to keep the dialog after file reads
  were already gated. The Keychain approval marker moves to plugin state
  (`cursor-keychain-approved`); configure copies a legacy
  `~/.cursor/.herdr-keychain-approved` once. A CLI login never falls through
  to the IDE token, including `AGENT_CLI_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file`.

### Added

- Agent setup playbook (`docs/agent-setup.md`, `docs/agent-setup.zh-CN.md`)
  and a copy-paste prompt in both READMEs, so a coding agent on the machine
  that runs Herdr can detect local CLIs, install matching collectors, and
  finish font maps, Herdr integrations, and macOS Keychain approval instead
  of stopping at `./install.sh`.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Teal (unseen-done) brand icons no longer sit one cell to the right of idle
  ones. Colour is a `rules` match on `$quota_icon` so the glyph stays the
  first identity token; a later `$quota_icon_done` twin hang-indented under
  the Space name. Working uses U+2061, not ZWNJ: ZWNJ joins the vendor PUA
  glyph and the icon font then draws a yellow `?`.
- Cursor quota follows a `cursor-agent login` account switch on macOS. The
  CLI now stores that login in Keychain (`cursor-access-token` /
  `cursor-user`) and no longer writes `auth.json`; the collector was falling
  through to a stale desktop `state.vscdb` token. It now reads the CLI
  Keychain item (after a one-time `--keychain-approve`) and does not borrow
  the IDE token while `cli-config.json` still has `authInfo`.
- Cursor sidebar model follows the CLI footer after a model switch:
  `lastUsedModel` of `default` / `auto` uses `cli-config.json` instead of
  staying labelled Auto.

### Changed

- Account quota windows (`5h` / `7d` / `30d`) appear on one pane per
  login-scoped vendor in each Space (Grok, Codex, Devin, OpenCode, Cursor).
  Extra tabs of that vendor in the same Space stay in the Agent panel with
  their model, topic, and context; only the duplicate 5h/7d/30d rows are
  omitted. The lexicographically first pane id in that Space keeps the
  windows, so focus and working status do not move the shared row. A Grok
  in another Space keeps its own windows. OpenCode and OpenCode Go are the
  same group. Claude and Agy stay per-pane. On a wide sidebar, two or more
  panes of the same vendor
  in one Space nest: the head is the brand icon, vendor name, and quota;
  every pane of that vendor still lists model, topic, and context. Extra
  tabs have no icon and use the same Space indent as other agents, not an
  extra nest. Narrow sidebars stay flat. Nested vendor children stay
  flush even when the settings row gap is 1: Herdr's own `row_gap` would
  also split those children, so the plugin packs the sidebar and paints
  the blank after the last child (and after un-nested panes).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-17

### Changed

- Agent order defaults to `quota`: Space grouping with least headroom first
  inside each space. `configure` also writes `ui.agent_panel_sort = "spaces"`
  when the user has not set a sort themselves.
- Default sidebar fields omit cache and TTL (`provider,topic,model,context,5h,7d,30d`).
  Turn them on in settings when needed.
- Sidebar identity uses Space group headers plus brand icons whose colour
  mirrors Herdr `agent_status` (working / done / idle) — no `state_icon` ring.
  README screenshots show the wide gauges layout only.

### Added

- The Claude Code status line ends with a spending pace for the binding
  quota window, `⏱ 5h ↓12%`: quota consumed versus how much of the window's
  clock has run, in points. `↓` means slow down, `↑` means there is headroom,
  `=` is within five points. It paces against the live window with the least
  remaining quota and names it (`5h`/`7d`); when that window cannot be paced
  nothing is shown rather than pacing the looser one: no reset time, expired,
  or in the first 5% of the window.
- Cursor Agent CLI is a supported harness: `--agent cursor`, `--provider cursor`,
  its own settings row, and a sidebar row with a Cursor brand color. Quota is
  the included monthly pool from the same
  `aiserver.v1.DashboardService/GetCurrentPeriodUsage` call the CLI makes,
  authenticated with `accessToken` in `~/.cursor/auth.json` (macOS) or
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cursor/auth.json` (Linux), or `$CURSOR_AUTH_FILE`. When
  that file is missing or has no token, the collector reads only
  `cursorAuth/accessToken` from the desktop app's `state.vscdb`, opened
  read-only. The IDE database's mtime is never a credential gate. Included
  follows the CLI usage panel: `totalPercentUsed` when present, otherwise
  `includedSpend / limit`. Auto, API, and Included map onto at / api / 30d.
  A 30d sidebar field was added so a monthly window is not hidden behind 7d.
  Model comes from
  `cli-config.json` (`selectedModel` mapped through `model.displayName`); a
  session's `lastUsedModel` overrides it. The sidebar title uses Grok's hue.
  The generated session title (`meta.json` `title`, else `store.db` `name`) is
  the topic, so a follow-up does not replace the session name; placeholder
  `New Agent` falls back to the last `<user_query>` in the session jsonl.
  Cursor panes are never read. Cache and context come from the interactive CLI's
  `afterAgentResponse` / `stop` / `preCompact` hooks (token counts and, when
  present, `context_usage_percent` / `context_window_size`). Composer 2.x
  uses its documented 200k window when the hook omits the size. Cycle end is
  Unix milliseconds. Snapshots are stamped with
  `sha256("cursor\0" || token)`. The collector never writes or refreshes
  Cursor credentials, never opens Keychain, and never calls a bare `agent`
  binary.

### Fixed

- Sidebar quota rows that would have printed `N/A` are omitted instead, for
  every provider. A missing or expired 5h/7d/30d window no longer occupies a
  row; `quota_error` still explains an unusable snapshot.
- Cursor `cx` now reads `store.db` `token_details` (`used_tokens` /
  `max_tokens`), the same conversation accounting the CLI footer shows as
  `Auto · 8.1%`. Hook mailboxes still supply cache, and remain the fallback
  when a session store has no token details.
- Agy Gemini sessions also publish the third-party (Claude/GPT) pool as `api`
  on the monthly slot, so that quota is visible without replacing 5h/7d.

- Cursor sidebar topic prefers the generated session title over the last
  `<user_query>`, so a follow-up like "look back at our todos" no longer
  replaces the session name. Placeholder `New Agent` still falls back to the
  last query.
- Grok sidebar topic uses `summary.json` `generated_title` (else
  `session_summary`) from the local session metadata, so a pane whose last
  prompt has scrolled off still has a name. Chat history is not read.
- Codex sidebar model no longer sticks on the session-start `turn_context`.
  A long turn writes `turn_context` once at the beginning, then enough
  `token_count` / tool output that the 256 KB tail has no model line. The
  previous head fallback then published the first turn's model (`Codex/gpt-6-astra`
  while the TUI footer already showed `gpt-5.6-sol`). The collector now
  scans backwards from EOF for the latest `turn_context`, capped so a 40 MB
  rollout is not read on every watch pulse.
- `rustls` 0.23.43 → 0.23.45 (`RUSTSEC-2026-0285`). It is a `ureq` TLS
  dependency; the collector sends bearer tokens to provider endpoints, so a
  known-vulnerable handshake stack fails `cargo audit --deny warnings`.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Muse Code (Meta Muse Spark) is a supported harness: `--agent muse`,
  `--provider muse`, its own settings row, and a sidebar row with a Muse brand
  color. Quota is the `subs_usage` block of the same `muse-code/key` call the
  CLI makes at startup and for `/usage`, authenticated with the account login
  in `~/.config/muse/auth.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `$MUSE_AUTH_PATH`).
  A `storage: "keychain"` login (typical on macOS) keeps the token out of that
  file; the collector reads the CLI's Keychain item through
  `security find-generic-password`, with a deadline so a prompt cannot stall a
  refresh, and keeps a successful token in-process for the daemon lifetime.
  The call returns the key the CLI already stored, so polling it does not
  sign Muse out. The session window is published as 5h and the weekly window
  as 7d; a different advertised session length keeps its own label. Only the
  usage block is read — the key and account identity in the same response
  are discarded. Snapshots are stamped with `sha256("muse\0" || token)`.
  API-key logins and inactive subscriptions show no quota but keep the
  session fields below. A rejected token or a failed request keeps the last
  quota cached for that account.
- Muse panes get model, topic, context, and cache like other agents. Herdr
  reports no Muse session, so on Linux the pane is matched to its session
  through Muse's own `.session.lock` (`pid=<n>`) and the `HERDR_PANE_ID` the
  `muse-bin` process inherited. The session's `session.jsonl` tail supplies
  the last model call's model and token usage — context against the local
  `model-catalog` limit, cache as that call's read share — and the last
  submitted prompt as the topic, so Muse panes are never read for a topic.
  Muse publishes no prompt-cache lifetime, so there is no TTL. Without that
  evidence (for example on macOS) the pane shows quota and the default model
  only.
- The provider name is a sidebar field like any other: `--fields` and the
  settings pane accept `provider`, listed first. It defaults on, so an
  existing configuration renders exactly as before; turning it off leaves the
  row with its icon and numbers. A packed identity row follows its two halves,
  so hiding the model degrades `$quota_provider_model` to `$quota_provider`,
  hiding the provider degrades it to `$quota_model`, and hiding both writes
  no identity row. The error token stays unconditional: it says the plugin
  could not speak for a pane, which is a failure, not a field.

### Fixed

- A saved agent list that was complete before a new provider was added no
  longer makes `configure` abort when omp is not installed. Those builds
  wrote "everything on" as an enumeration (`claude,codex,grok,agy,opencode,pi,omp,devin`
  before Muse), which was then judged partial against the longer supported
  list, so a missing omp integration became a hard failure. That exact
  prefix is still read as every agent. A complete selection is now stored
  as `all`, and a subset with a leading `only` marker, so turning the
  newest agent off is not mistaken for the legacy full list.
- An idle pane now follows its own session's quota as soon as the cache has it.
  A Claude statusLine hook only writes the observation mailbox, so a pane that
  never starts a turn kept publishing whatever it last published: one pane sat
  on `7d 24%` and `5h N/A` while its session's stored windows had moved on and
  every sibling pane showed the new reading. A watch pass now also covers an
  idle pane whose published quota rows differ from the ones its cached
  snapshot would render, alongside the existing expired-window case.
- A `fields` preference saved before the provider was a field no longer hides
  the provider on upgrade. Those builds wrote "everything on" as
  `topic,model,cache,ttl,context,5h,7d` and drew the provider name regardless,
  so that exact list is still read as every field. A selection that hides only
  the provider is stored with a leading `no-provider` marker, which names it
  without being mistaken for that legacy list.
- Gauges now keeps `no cached` as an amber token when it joins the cache row;
  live TTL continues to fold into the uncoloured cache token.
- `omp usage` now passes `--profile` when the pane's agent directory is an omp
  named profile (`~/.omp/profiles/<name>/agent`), so that pane is billed to
  the profile's credential store rather than the default one. Non-profile
  layouts still use `PI_CONFIG_DIR`.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- A third sidebar layout, `gauges`, now the default: each quota field gets
  its own row with a meter beside the number. Bars fill to the printed
  number, so `cx`, `5h`, `7d` and `30d` all follow `quota-percent`
  (remaining by default). Labels are three characters so those periods
  align; a provider-named window too long for the column keeps a plain row.
  Cache and TTL share a line when they fit (`cache 95.2% · ttl≈29m`) and
  split when the sidebar is too narrow. Meters size to the connected Herdr
  endpoint after its secondary-row indent and scrollbar — six cells at the
  default 26 columns, twelve at 32 or wider — and drop rather than clip.
  The `cx` row takes a muted green/amber/red colour from remaining context.
  New installs use `gauges`. Existing `packed` or `stacked` preferences are
  kept and can still be chosen from the settings pane.

### Fixed

- A `gauges` sidebar that is too narrow for a meter no longer flips the
  context number from remaining to used. Width lookup reads the connected
  endpoint's client-shell file instead of whichever state file was written
  last.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Idle panes no longer keep a frozen remaining count after a quota window
  resets. One policy covers every collector: a cached window whose reset is in
  the past bypasses the 60-second fetch debounce, and a watcher already running
  for another agent includes only those panes whose *displayed* windows have
  expired. Codex `/status` is still a session-local cache and is not scraped.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Drop the native `agent` row from managed sidebar layouts. It duplicated the
  branded `$quota_provider_model` line (`grok` above `Grok/grok-4.6`). The
  machine/workspace/tab row stays; uninstall puts `agent` back.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Recover background quota updates across Herdr upgrades and live handoffs;
  normal installation/repair restores the watcher and retains preferences.
  Refresh and event paths respect the saved agent selection.
- Include Pi, OMP, and OpenCode in active-turn polling and complete a delayed
  final refresh when a turn ends inside the request debounce window.
- Bind OpenCode Go and ID-less Grok caches to their credentials; retain OMP
  readings for all reported account pins without spawning once per account.
- Remove unverified Codex rollout windows and rebuild legacy quota data from
  authoritative API responses or original StatusLine payloads.

### Changed

- Claude/Agy quota is session-local because StatusLine does not prove account
  identity. An unknown Agy model no longer combines two quota pools.
- Consolidate English/Chinese usage and upgrade documentation; separate dated
  research from current guidance and remove the completed internal task plan.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Require Herdr 0.9.0 or later. Native machine/workspace/tab and agent
  identity rows stay above plugin fields in both sidebar layouts.
- Keep Herdr's native token styling, Space Git rows, and worktree grouping.
  Quota ordering remains opt-in.

### Fixed

- Focus events refresh the pane named in the event instead of the current
  global focus, including delayed events and independent Herdr clients.
- Reconfiguring managed shared Agent rows preserves added custom fields and
  styles while still migrating recognized older plugin layouts.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Devin CLI is a supported harness: `--agent devin`, its own settings row,
  and a sidebar row with a Devin brand color. Quota comes from the same
  Connect RPC `GetUserStatus` contract the Devin CLI uses, with the key read
  from `~/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml` (or `$DEVIN_CREDENTIALS_FILE`).
  Daily and weekly remaining percentages are flipped to used. The configured
  default model comes from `~/.config/devin/config.json` `agent.model` when
  present, then mapped through local `devin-models.json` for a display name.
  New sessions that never run `/model` use this same value. It is published
  as `snapshot.model` and used as the fallback when a session is not in
  `sessions.db`. The API `planInfo.planName` is the subscription plan and is
  not used as a model. A missing or malformed models catalog leaves the raw
  id and does not fail the quota fetch. Per-session active models are read
  from `~/.local/share/devin/cli/sessions.db` (SQLite, read-only, selecting
  only `id` and `model` — the omp `models.db` discipline, not `agent.db`),
  so two panes running different `/model` selections each show their own
  model.
  Snapshots are stamped with `sha256("devin\0" || key)`
  so a credential swap cannot keep the previous account's last-good value.
  The API key is never logged, stored, or included in error messages.
- `configure --apply` rewrites the shared `ui.sidebar.agents.rows` array only
  when it is empty, already managed by this plugin, or matches Herdr's default
  `["state_icon", "agent"]` row. Rows from another plugin or the user are
  left intact; `rows_by_agent`, managed `row_gap`, and keybindings are still
  added or updated. `workspace` and `pane` tokens are not treated as a safe
  default, so they cannot be silently replaced with `tab`.

### Changed

- Devin private orchestration under `.devin/` is not part of the published
  tree. Local Devin state stays gitignored, matching `.agents/`.

### Fixed

- Idle Claude panes on the same `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` profile now share that
  profile's newest 5h/7d reading instead of freezing the last statusLine tick
  for each conversation. A later idle tick that repeats an older percentage
  for the same reset does not roll the shared figure back. Separate
  work/personal config directories stay isolated, including when their reset
  times happen to match. A window whose `resets_at` has already passed is
  shown as unknown rather than as a live percentage. Based on the report in
  #57.
- `configure` no longer runs `normalize_official_row` when generating
  `rows_by_agent` from user-owned shared rows, so tokens such as `pane` and
  `terminal_title_stripped` stay intact. With brand colors off, those custom
  shared rows still get plugin-managed per-agent quota rows — only the brand
  hue is omitted. Default Herdr rows are unchanged: brand off still writes no
  `rows_by_agent` copies.
- `configure` prints which user-owned `rows_by_agent` entries it left alone,
  instead of succeeding silently without installing quota for those agents.
- Sidebar tab names, topics, cache details, context, and unknown quota states
  now inherit Herdr's active theme instead of using text colors tuned for a
  dark background. Provider brand hues and quota severity colors remain
  plugin-owned because they carry plugin-specific meaning.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- omp (oh-my-pi) is a supported harness: `--agent omp`, its own settings row,
  and automatic installation of Herdr's `omp` integration when selected. Model,
  context, and cache come from the same transcript reader Pi uses — omp is a
  fork of Pi and still writes JSONL v3 — with two field renames handled in the
  shared parser (`cttl.ephemeral1h` for Anthropic's one-hour cache writes, and
  omp's authoritative `contextTokens`). The agent directory is recovered from
  the absolute session path Herdr reports rather than from this process's
  environment, so a pane started under `PI_CONFIG_DIR` or `--profile` is read
  against its own state.
- omp quota comes from omp's own usage layer, `omp usage --json --provider
  <id>`, and is cached in a credential scope of its own: an omp pane billed to
  Claude never reads (or writes) the canonical Claude snapshot, because the two
  can be different subscriptions. The call is debounced to once a minute per
  provider and omp answers it from its own five-minute usage cache, so it is
  not a provider request per event. `omp usage` is asked only about the one
  provider the pane is talking to, never about the whole credential pool.
- omp records the account that served a session as a `credential_pin`; the same
  digest is recomputed from the usage report's identity, so two accounts on one
  provider each get their own quota. With several accounts and no pin the pane
  shows no quota rather than a peer account's, and a provider that only holds
  an API key in omp is confirmed pay-as-you-go and clears stale quota.
- `HERDR_AGENT_QUOTA_OMP_BIN` overrides the `omp` executable.
- An omp OAuth login that is attributable to the pane but has no usage report
  now renders quota as `N/A` instead of looking unsupported. A last-good
  snapshot for that same account is still preserved, and failed first fetches
  now honor the one-minute debounce instead of spawning `omp usage` again on
  every pane event.
- OMP quota windows are rendered with OMP's normalized labels instead of a
  second set of per-provider rules. Daily and monthly reports such as `1d` and
  `Monthly` now reach the existing short/long sidebar rows rather than being
  dropped.
- **Open agent quota settings** is a plugin action bound to
  `prefix+shift+q`; Herdr 0.8 does not expose extension points for its built-in
  Settings tabs or bottom-right menu.

### Changed

- OMP now uses the previous OpenCode violet brand color; OpenCode uses the
  neutral identity color OMP previously inherited.
- Both READMEs were reduced to feature, support, settings, integration, and
  troubleshooting tables, and now include the full settings-pane screenshot
  and copy-ready commands.

### Fixed

- OMP providers such as `google-antigravity` now route through OMP's generic
  usage collector instead of being excluded by the legacy provider allowlist.
  Provider ids have isolated hashed cache/debounce keys.
- The settings popup no longer repeats its title inside Herdr's titled pane.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `--agent-order quota` sorts Herdr's Agent panel by the least quota left, so
  the agent closest to its limit is at the top. It is a Herdr `agent.view.set`
  owned by this plugin, sorted on a new `quota_headroom` token — the remaining
  percentage of the tighter of the pane's 5h and 7d windows, zero-padded so
  Herdr's ordering of the token text is also its numeric ordering. The token is
  published for every pane whose quota is known, whether or not the order is
  enabled, because nothing renders it: that makes changing the order a
  Herdr-side toggle rather than a metadata write to every pane, and it costs no
  extra writes, since the value only moves when a quota token beside it moves
  anyway. Herdr keeps one Agent view, so this replaces the user's own
  `ui.agent_panel_sort` until it is set back to `default`; a full uninstall
  hands the panel back. The view does not survive a Herdr restart, so the
  plugin's startup hook re-applies it — and only when it is this plugin's to
  re-apply, leaving a view someone else owns alone.
- `--low-quota-alert <percent>` shows one Herdr notification when a provider's
  remaining quota falls to that percentage or below. One warning per provider,
  not per pane; silent for as long as the quota stays low; re-armed only by
  recovering above the threshold, so a window that resets and is spent again
  warns again. A provider with no pane in a pass keeps its state, so closing
  and reopening a pane is not a way to be warned twice. `off` is the default:
  a plugin that starts notifying after an upgrade is a plugin people turn off.
- A `startup` subcommand, now the plugin's startup hook. It restores the Herdr
  state this plugin owns before running the refresh the hook used to run on its
  own. Startup hooks run again after a server restart or a live handoff, which
  is exactly when Herdr has dropped the Agent view.
- An **Agent quota settings** popup pane. It edits the percentage style, the
  sidebar layout, the row gap, the watcher interval, the brand colours, the
  visible fields, and the installed agents, and applies them by re-invoking
  `configure` with every value named explicitly, then reloading Herdr's
  configuration and forcing one refresh — the same path the "Install / repair"
  action takes, so there is still one writer for the sidebar rows and the
  statusLine entries. Herdr injects `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR`,
  `HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR`, and `HERDR_BIN_PATH` into a pane, which is what
  makes this possible; it was verified with a throwaway `printenv` pane.
  Unchecking an agent uninstalls that agent's collector and restores its own
  statusLine, so it asks for a second keypress first, and the last agent
  cannot be unchecked.
- `--fields` chooses which quota fields the sidebar shows: `all` (default),
  `none`, or a comma-separated list of `topic`, `model`, `cache`, `ttl`,
  `context`, `5h`, `7d`. The provider name and the error token are not
  optional — a row that cannot say which subscription it belongs to, or that
  hides why quota is missing, is worse than no row. Hiding the model degrades
  the packed identity token from `$quota_provider_model` to `$quota_provider`
  rather than leaving the row nameless.
- `--brand-colors off` drops the per-agent hues on provider and model. Severity
  colours are unaffected: they are information, not decoration. With the hues
  off the plugin writes no `rows_by_agent` entries at all, rather than copies
  of the shared rows.
- Quota percentages can read as consumed instead of remaining. `--quota-percent
  used` (on `./install.sh` and `herdr-agent-quota configure --apply`, or
  `$HERDR_AGENT_QUOTA_PERCENT` for a direct CLI run) flips every 5h/7d/30d
  number in the sidebar and the dashboard; `remaining` stays the default. The
  sidebar token keeps its width — no `left`/`used` word rides along — and the
  severity colour is still computed from the remaining quota, so red keeps
  meaning "little runway". The choice is stored in the plugin state directory
  as well as the config directory, because the Claude/Agy statusLine hooks are
  launched by their harness with only `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` set.

### Changed

- The settings popup now opens 78x30 instead of Herdr's default half-size
  popup. The pane draws one row per option and the list is longer than 24
  rows, so the agents section used to open below the fold.

### Fixed

- Agy quota is no longer misread when a bucket reports `remaining_percent`
  rather than `remaining_fraction`. The scale now comes from the key name; the
  previous "below 1.0 means a fraction" heuristic rendered `remaining_percent:
  1.0` — a nearly exhausted pool — as 100% remaining and coloured it green.
- `./install.sh --agent`, `./uninstall.sh --agent`, and
  `--watch-interval-seconds` now reach `configure`. Herdr runs a plugin action
  with a fixed command line in the **server's** environment, so the variables
  these scripts exported were silently dropped: `./uninstall.sh --agent grok`
  removed every agent's configuration instead of Grok's. The selection now
  travels through the plugin config directory, as the sidebar layout and row
  gap already did, and `uninstall.sh` restores the previous value afterwards.
- A single-pane agent event no longer discards the other panes' cached context
  and model. The fetch only enriches the session the event named, and the save
  path dropped every session it had not looked at, so a sibling pane's context
  was cleared and then republished on the next refresh — one avoidable
  metadata write, and one avoidable repaint, per cycle.
- The dashboard pane now lists OpenCode Go, including the 30d window that the
  sidebar has no token for. Both READMEs promised this; nothing rendered it.
- `configure --apply` keeps the user's own key order in
  `~/.claude/settings.json` instead of re-sorting the whole file.

### Added

- Grok plans billed monthly report a 30d window instead of failing to parse.
  The sidebar's long-window slot carries the weekly allowance, or the monthly
  one when a plan has no weekly bucket; the period label travels inside the
  value (`30d 70% 17d8h`), and a weekly window always wins the slot when both
  exist, so a monthly number is never displayed as a weekly one.
- A lapsed prompt cache publishes `quota_cache_state` (`no cached`) instead of
  sharing `quota_error` with real failures. Both render amber, so the two were
  previously indistinguishable even though one is a normal state.
- CI runs `cargo audit`, on pull requests and weekly.

### Removed

- `Severity::Caution` and its `quota_*_caution` sidebar tokens. The variant was
  unreachable, so those rows could never be filled.
- The `omp` and `kimi` harness names. Neither had a collector, a sidebar row,
  or an integration; a detected pane produced no tokens at all, and a status
  event still paid for one pane read to extract a topic that was then dropped.
- `MetadataTokens` fields, and the metadata names behind them, that nothing
  published: `quota_state`, `quota_icon`, `quota_status`, `quota_summary`, and
  the per-window `_label` / `_percent` / `_eta` splits. They were compared on
  every refresh and competed for Herdr's 16-token report budget. Panes still
  carrying them are cleaned up on the next report.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Sidebar rows can be `packed` (default: join cache/TTL and 5h/7d on one row)
  or `stacked` (provider, model, cache, TTL, context, 5h, and 7d each on their
  own row). Plugin-owned `row_gap` defaults to `1` so adjacent panes are not
  packed flush; `--row-gap 0` packs them together. A user-owned `row_gap` is
  left alone. Herdr only accepts whole rows. `configure --sidebar-layout` /
  `--row-gap`, `./install.sh --sidebar-layout` / `--row-gap`, and the matching
  plugin config-dir prefs select them; the choice is stored so a later repair
  keeps it. Empty tokens still collapse in both layouts. Herdr itself does not
  wrap overflowing tokens.
- Codex now publishes an estimated prompt cache TTL. The rollout JSONL records
  no TTL and no expiry, so the countdown is the documented 30 minute
  `prompt_cache_options.ttl` anchored to the timestamp of the last recorded
  request. The same estimate covers Pi `openai-codex` sessions, anchored to the
  latest assistant message with cache activity. `cache_write_input_tokens` is
  not used as the anchor: ChatGPT-backed sessions report 0 there even while
  cached reads are large.

### Changed

- Sidebar color is two systems: brand answers who, status answers remaining
  quota. Provider uses the brand hue; model uses the dim sibling. Tab names
  are `#eceef2`, prompts `#c8cdd6`, cache/TTL/context `#969eae`. Compact
  `5h 0% 1h18m` / `7d 72% 5d22h` windows (spaces, no middle dots) take the
  remaining-percent color: green at 50%+, amber at 20–49%, red below 20%.
  `no cached` uses that same amber. Herdr joins sibling tokens with ` · `,
  so a window is one token. Selected state must not change provider hue. Selected-card
  fill is left to Herdr: `theme.custom.selection_bg` / `active_row_bg` exist
  from 0.8.2, 0.8.0 rejects them, and the intended fill is `#42474f`.
  Codex is cold white-blue, Claude coral, Agy Gemini blue, Grok silver,
  OpenCode the former Grok purple, Pi mauve.
- Claude cache TTL now comes from statusLine `prompt_cache.expires_at`
  (Claude Code v2.1.251+). Transcript-tail guesses from
  `ephemeral_5m`/`ephemeral_1h` buckets are gone. A cold or missing prefix
  hides the countdown instead of keeping a stale estimate. Pi/Anthropic still
  uses its recorded `cacheWrite1h` split.

### Fixed

- Grok panes no longer hide context/cache when Herdr binds the process's empty
  session-start id. `active_sessions.json` can list that stub and the real
  conversation under one PID; the stub has a model and no `signals.json`, so
  the same-PID sibling supplies the missing numbers. A different PID is never
  used, and a bound session that already has context is left alone.
- Switching Codex ChatGPT accounts no longer keeps the previous login's 5h
  row. The live `account/rateLimits/read` result is the account-level source;
  a local rollout may fill an omitted 5h window only when that file is at
  least as new as `auth.json` and its weekly window still matches. A cache
  from another account, or from before the current credential file, is not
  merged back. Weekly-only accounts now hide 5h immediately instead of after
  the next turn.

### Notes

- Recorded expiries still win where they exist: Claude Code
  `prompt_cache.expires_at` and Pi/Anthropic `cacheWrite1h`. Codex is the one
  place where a documented, model-independent TTL makes an estimate worth
  publishing. Grok, Agy, OpenCode, and other Pi backends have neither an entry
  expiry nor a documented TTL in their local contracts, so they keep cache hit
  rate and leave TTL blank rather than guessing a one-hour countdown.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- `configure --agent` installs and removes one agent at a time. Values are
  `all` (the default), `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `agy`, `opencode` and `pi`, and can
  be repeated or comma-separated. An agent you do not select gets no sidebar
  row, no statusLine entry and no hook file, so nothing of theirs is created on
  a machine that does not use them. `install.sh --agent` and
  `uninstall.sh --agent` pass the same selection through
  `HERDR_AGENT_QUOTA_AGENTS`, because Herdr plugin actions run a fixed command
  line. Removing one agent leaves the others installed and never touches the
  shared watcher, poll interval or config backup; `--uninstall` with no
  selection still removes everything.
- `configure` now reports when Herdr's own integration for a selected agent is
  missing. Without it Herdr reports no session id for that agent's panes, so
  quota cannot be attributed and the pane stays blank with no other clue. The
  integration belongs to Herdr (`herdr integration install <agent>`); this
  plugin never installs or changes it.
- OpenCode Go quota, fetched once per resolved pane from the official
  `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage` endpoint using the key OpenCode already
  stores for its own `opencode-go` backend. The dashboard also renders a monthly
  window; the sidebar stays at 5h/7d because there is no monthly token.
  This provider is best-effort: the repository maintainer has no Go
  subscription, so the response shape comes from CodexBar's implementation and
  tests rather than an observed live response, cited in
  `docs/research/opencode-go-usage.md`. It fails closed on anything unexpected
  and cannot affect the other providers, which keep their exact previous
  behavior. Corrections from anyone with a subscription are welcome.
- OpenCode panes are resolved to a billing target from the exact Herdr session
  id, looked up read-only in `opencode.db` and classified against the
  credential filed for that backend in OpenCode's `auth.json`. Confirmed
  pay-as-you-go clears stale quota once; missing, unreadable or ambiguous
  evidence preserves whatever the pane already shows.
- Exact OpenCode sessions publish their local provider/model and context even
  when the backend has no supported subscription collector. Context follows
  OpenCode's own latest-completed-assistant token formula and bounded local
  model cache; no credential or unrelated session is consulted.

### Changed

- `event` and `focus` act on exactly one named pane from a single agent
  inventory, so a sibling pane on the same subscription receives neither a pane
  read nor a metadata write.
- Plugin-owned sidebar spacing now migrates to Herdr's packed `row_gap = 0`;
  empty metadata rows collapse dynamically, while user-owned spacing remains
  unchanged.
- Cache TTL is published only from a recorded provider bucket. Pi/Anthropic
  sessions now use their `cacheWrite1h` split and request-start timestamp;
  Codex keeps its cache hit rate but no longer guesses a one-hour expiry from a
  rollout event timestamp.
- Missing-integration diagnostics now cover Pi as well as OpenCode and tell the
  user to restart the affected pane after installation.
- The English and Chinese READMEs now lead with installation prerequisites,
  exact route coverage, accuracy gaps, privacy, and concise troubleshooting.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- Rebuilding the plugin no longer leaves a stale active-turn watcher that
  keeps publishing the old weekly token. That leftover `$quota_week_normal`
  stacked on `$quota_week_inline_*` and made Grok show `7d` twice.
- Claude/Agy quota windows are remembered per statusLine session so a work
  and a personal login no longer overwrite each other's 5h/7d rows. Grok and
  Codex still publish the account-level windows to every pane of that login;
  a Claude session that has not reported yet shows unavailable instead of
  borrowing another account's numbers. Based on work by @joshfinnie in #30.

### Changed

- Sidebar cards now decide from the 5h token, not the provider name, whether
  weekly quota sits beside context. A present 5h window keeps `5h` and `7d`
  on the limits row so they never share a line with context; an empty 5h
  publishes week on the context row instead, so weekly-only cards still read
  `context · 7d`. Codex can therefore split when OpenAI returns 5h and fold
  after a reset; Grok, Claude, and Agy keep their previous visual shape.
- Agy/Antigravity quota now shows the pool that the active model actually
  draws from instead of the conservative minimum across both pools. Gemini-family
  model names (`gemini`, `flash`, `learnlm`) select the `gemini-*` pool;
  Claude, Sonnet, Haiku, Opus, GPT, and OpenAI o-series models select the
  `3p-*` pool. Unrecognised model names fall back to the previous behaviour
  (minimum across both pools) so the sidebar remains correct after a provider
  adds a new model name without a plugin update.

### Added

- Provider rows now use one compact `$quota_provider_model` identity token
  (`Provider/Model`, with the model omitted when unavailable); provider and
  model share the provider's brand color. Context is the penultimate row,
  while cache diagnostics use a dedicated row: a one-decimal cumulative
  session hit rate and the elapsed time
  since the latest cache-bearing response plus an explicitly approximate TTL
  estimate when the provider exposes a cache bucket or Codex supplies a
  timestamped cache-bearing rollout event. Claude/Agy collectors use local
  statusLine/transcript data only; they do not log in or start model requests.
- Codex now reads the bounded tail of each matching local rollout to publish
  per-session model, current context, and cumulative cache diagnostics. Grok
  supplements its billing snapshot with bounded local `signals.json` and
  `updates.jsonl` session metadata, so both providers expose context/cache when
  the local session files contain those fields; missing data remains hidden.
- Grok session matching no longer requires `signals.json`. Newer CLI sessions
  may only have `summary.json` until the first usage signal; the model still
  comes from `current_model_id`. Context and cache stay hidden until
  `signals.json` / usage updates exist.
- Grok's weekly-only limit is placed beside context in its provider-specific
  row, and Claude/Agy statusLine diagnostics are keyed by session so a fresh
  session cannot inherit another session's cache. All per-session maps are
  bounded to 128 entries.
- A pane without a Herdr session id no longer receives provider-global
  context/cache diagnostics. This prevents a fresh Grok or Agy pane from
  showing another session's cached usage; diagnostics appear once the current
  session can be matched. Weekly labels use the compact `7d` form everywhere.
- Quota rows now show compact `5h`/`7d` window labels with minutes below one
  hour, hours and minutes below one day, and days plus hours for longer windows.
- Cache hit rate and remaining cache TTL now share one short, color-separated
  sidebar row; the verbose last-activity text is no longer shown.
- Cache, TTL, and context diagnostics now share one muted blue-gray style;
  provider/model keep their brand color, while green/amber/red are reserved
  for quota runway health and explicit errors.
- Claude's plugin-owned statusLine now receives the configured global watcher
  interval as its native `refreshInterval`, keeping idle-session reset times
  fresh without an API call or model request; existing user-owned intervals are
  preserved.
- Active turns now start one short-lived global refresh watcher for Claude,
  Codex, Grok, and Agy. It reads the working provider set once per poll,
  publishes statusLine cache updates, keeps active fetches debounced, stops
  when all agents settle, and performs final debounced passes per provider.
  Polling defaults to 60 seconds and is configurable from 30 seconds to one
  hour. `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` provide a build/link/configure and
  restore/unlink workflow for downloaded checkouts.

### Fixed

- Codex and Claude no longer drop a still-current five-hour window when the
  latest payload omits it. The previous 5h value is restored only when its
  reset is still in the future and a sibling window present in both snapshots
  has not itself reset; an empty window list still clears stale quota.
- Codex also reads five-hour limits from `rateLimitsByLimitId`, from
  near-duration token-count headers, and from the latest matching local
  rollout when the app-server omits `secondary`. A newer weekly-only event
  does not restore a stale 5h value. When 5h is genuinely absent, Codex
  elides `$quota_5h` like Grok so the card reads `context · 7d`.
- Codex quota parsing now keeps both provider-reported five-hour and seven-day
  windows. It identifies each window by duration instead of assuming that
  `primary` or `secondary` has a fixed meaning, so the restored five-hour limit
  appears in the sidebar again.
- Grok no longer sticks at `week 0%` after `grok login` switches accounts. A
  fresh SuperGrok week omits `creditUsagePercent` (proto3 JSON drops zeros),
  which the parser treated as an unsupported response and then kept the previous
  login's exhausted snapshot. Omitted/null percent is 0% used (100% remaining),
  snapshots are stamped with the signed-in `user_id`, and a cache from another
  account is not published. Codex has the same per-provider cache and now
  stamps `tokens.account_id` from `~/.codex/auth.json` so a ChatGPT account
  switch cannot keep the previous user's weekly percent. Claude and Agy read
  the running CLI's statusLine, so they were not affected.
- Claude/Agy statusLine collectors now publish atomic observations without
  waiting on refresh work. Provider refreshes use independent non-blocking
  leases, and chained user statusLine commands run in a bounded process group
  so a stalled command cannot leak processes or wedge later invocations.
- Topic extraction now reads the pane's visible screen instead of rebuilding its
  wrapped scrollback. The old `--source recent` read took 4.45s and repainted the
  pane once per call, which is what the user saw as scrolling; `--source visible`
  costs 0.006s and repaints nothing. The prompt is on screen when a turn starts,
  which is when the topic changes.
- Agent events no longer repaint every pane of a provider. Reading a pane makes
  Herdr repaint it, which the user sees as the agent's terminal scrolling up and
  snapping back to the bottom, once on agent detection and twice per turn
  thereafter. An event now reads only the pane it names and publishes once
  instead of twice; the remaining panes keep the topic they last published.
- A failed or empty topic read now preserves the last published topic instead of
  clearing it, so it no longer churns the token and forces a write on the next
  refresh.
- The legacy per-tool Grok response hook is no longer installed. Existing
  plugin-owned copies are removed during configure because the single global
  watcher now covers active and settled turns without spawning one command per
  tool call.
- Expired cache TTL estimates now render as a red `no cached` diagnostic, and
  Claude payloads without quota fields clear stale window values instead of
  leaving an old weekly reset on the sidebar.
- Weekly windows now use the compact `7d ... reset ...` label, including
  weekly-only providers, so narrow sidebars do not truncate the label.
- Grok local-session enrichment now checks only the pane-matched two-level
  session paths, with a bounded newest-session fallback for direct refreshes;
  it no longer recursively scans the entire historical session tree.

- Agent topics now come only from the latest user prompt in pane output. Native
  `Thinking`/`Executing` titles and other AI status text are no longer published
  as the user's topic, including Grok's `❯` prompt format.
- Codex Unix timestamps and Claude's Unix/RFC 3339 statusLine variants now
  normalize correctly; Grok RFC 3339 period ends and Agy relative reset seconds
  use the same cached absolute time.

- The Claude collector stays visually silent when there was no previous
  `statusLine`, avoiding a plugin-owned line that Claude repaints after each
  interaction. Existing custom status lines are still chained unchanged.
- A pane that exits between `herdr agent list` and the metadata report no
  longer aborts the whole publish, so the remaining live panes still update.
- Closed a race in the Codex app-server watchdog that could signal an unrelated
  process after the child had been reaped and its pid recycled. The watchdog
  and the request thread now share the child and terminate it at most once.
- A failed cache rename no longer leaves its scratch file behind.

- Claude and Agy statusLine hooks now only update the local cache, so repainting
  an agent's own status line cannot synchronously call back into Herdr or move
  the terminal viewport. Metadata reports are skipped when every displayed
  token is unchanged.
- Focus changes now use a dedicated provider-only, 60-second-debounced refresh.
  This path never reads pane content or refreshes topics, and metadata writes
  remain suppressed while the selected pane is in scrollback.
- Agent detection and status events now refresh and read topics only for the
  affected provider. Pane exit no longer starts a refresh after its metadata
  consumer is already gone; incomplete event payloads still fall back to all
  providers.
- `configure --apply` now binds `prefix+shift+r` to the force-refresh action
  when that key is free, while preserving an existing user-owned binding.
  `configure --uninstall` removes only the plugin action binding.
- Grok now invokes a silent, provider-only refresh directly from `PostToolUse`
  during long-running turns, with turn-end hooks covering final, failed, and
  cancelled replies. It no longer routes these refreshes through a Herdr action,
  and remains debounced to avoid request storms.
- Quota-only refreshes no longer read every agent pane before publishing. They
  preserve the last topic token, update the sidebar as soon as quota collection
  finishes, and leave full topic extraction to agent lifecycle events.
- Agy's statusLine collector is now installed, repaired, chained, and removed
  by the same configuration lifecycle as Claude's, and remains silent when no
  user-owned status line existed.
- Configuration actions now install or uninstall all plugin-owned integrations
  in one pass and reload Herdr automatically. They also repair legacy
  collectors that pointed at a different cache directory while preserving any
  previous user statusLine backup.
- Metadata publication now skips panes whose viewport is in scrollback, so a
  Herdr repaint cannot pull the user back to the bottom. The next refresh after
  returning to the bottom catches the sidebar up.

### Changed

- The context row now uses a dedicated violet accent immediately after the
  provider name. Cache hit rate and remaining TTL share one row with separate
  teal and amber accents, while metadata publication remains capped at sixteen
  tokens.
- Quota formatting is centralized in one presentation module shared by the
  sidebar, dashboard, and statusLine fallbacks. Codex now publishes both its
  five-hour and weekly windows when the provider reports them.
- Five-hour and weekly quota windows now share one compact sidebar row. Herdr
  elides missing tokens and their separators, while each window keeps its own
  dynamic health color.
- Sidebar agent cards default to one blank row of separation, while preserving
  an existing `row_gap`. The latest user prompt now precedes compact,
  single-spaced quota rows, and percentages render as whole numbers.
- Default sidebar styling compares quota remaining with window time remaining:
  on-pace usage is bold green, behind-pace usage is brighter amber, and
  behind-pace usage below 20% remaining is bold red.
- Provider labels now use separate brand-aware `rows_by_agent` styling: Claude
  soft orange, Codex pastel blue, soft white for Grok, and Antigravity-inspired
  mint for Agy. Quota health colors use the same low-strain pastel palette.
  Existing user-owned agent row overrides remain untouched.

- Dropped the unmaintained `fs2` dependency in favour of the standard library's
  file locking, and made `libc` a Unix-only dependency.
- Removed the redundant `pkill` shell-out when tearing down the Codex
  app-server; killing the process group already covers its children.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Live Claude Code, Codex, Grok, and Agy/Antigravity subscription quotas in
  Herdr's agent sidebar, as five-hour and weekly remaining percentages.
- `configure --apply` / `--check` / `--uninstall` for a reversible, idempotent
  sidebar and Claude `statusLine` setup.
- A popup dashboard pane, event-driven refresh, and a local snapshot cache that
  survives provider failures.
